<h1>My Journey into Recurrent Networks and GANs</h1>

<p>
    This repository documents my exploration of two types of Recurrent Networks (RNNs and LSTMs), and also Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). I embarked on as part of my journey into the world of AI and time series data analysis. Each notebook represents a step forward in understanding these powerful models, showcasing both the learning process and the practical applications of RNNs in predicting sequential data.

<h2>RNN - Recurrent Neural Networks</h2>
<p>
    The starting point of this notebook is an exploration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), designed to handle sequential data. It covers their application in time series prediction, specifically focusing on weather forecasting. Following this, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model was also implemented and trained with different complexities. The GRU demonstrated improved results over the RNN in terms of performance.
    
<h2>LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory Networks</h2>
<p>
   Building on the foundation laid by RNNs, this notebook explores LSTMs, a more advanced type of recurrent network that addresses the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly in capturing long-term dependencies in data. Then the model was created and trained to analyze and forecast trends in the S&P 500 stock market data. 

<h2>GAN - Generative Adversarial Networks</h2>
<p>
   This notebook demonstrates how GANs can be built and trained using both TensorFlow and PyTorch, showcasing their ability to create synthetic data that mimics real-world examples.
